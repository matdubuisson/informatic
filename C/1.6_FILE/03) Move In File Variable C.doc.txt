				MOVE INSIDE

#4	fseek()
This function permits to move the cursor in the file
in comparison to an origin. There are there different
origins provided by stdio.h :
3# SEEK_SET 3# => In relation to the begin;
3# SEEK_CUR 3# => In relation to the current position;
3# SEEK_END 3# => In relation to the end;

fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET) => Means the first character;
fseek(f, -1, SEEK_END) => Means the last character;

#4	ftell()
It returns the position of the cursor in the file.
It's like the position of character in a string but
with one incremented. So : #5 index = ftell((FILE *) f) - 1;
