				SIZE

#1              SIZE OPERATORS
#2      Operator
There is a single operator for telling about size :
3# sizeof or sizeof() 3# => This returns the value of the
size of a data. It's the number of bytes. There are two
syntax with this operator :
sizeof(data); // It isn't a function !!
sizeof data;

Ex : 2# 
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  int var = 6;
  sizeof var; // Same than sizeof(var)
  sizeof(int); // It's sizeof (first operator) plus "(int)" (second operator)
  char Var = 14;
  sizeof var + Var;

  return 0;
}
