				ARITHMETIC OPERATOR

#1		ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
#2	The operators
There are five operators :
3# + 3# => Addition
3# - 3# => Soustraction
3# * 3# => Multiplication
3# / 3# => Division
3# % 3# => Modulo so returns the rest of an integer division

#2	Priority
The operators of multiplication and division have the priority on
the addition and the soustraction. Else the compilator reads the
lines from the left to the right.
Ex : 1// 
2 * 4 + 5; // = (2 * 4) + 5 = 5 + 4 * 2
2 * 5 / 6; // = (2 * 5) / 6
5 - 4 - 3 + 6; // = ((5 - 4) - 3) + 6
 1//

#2	Unary operation
This permits to get the value of a variable of the opposite.
Ex : 1// 
int e = 4, a;
a = +e; // same thing than : a = e;
a = -e;
 1//

#1		EXPOSANT
For writing an exposant in C, it needs to write a letter [ e or E ] next to
the number of the left and on the right of the number to put the power of the
exposant. By example :
2e10 = 2^10
4E-11 = 4^-11

There is an other letter that attaches the power on the right... It's the
letter [ f ]. In fact, this permirts to change the power number in #1 float
at the place of 1# double 1# so it takes less of memory but it loses a
few of precision. Ex :
2e10f = 2^10
4E-11f = 4^-11
