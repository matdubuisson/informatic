#1		SERVER SIDE

// GLOBAL VARIABLES
// fd = File Descriptor
working => Flag to tell the system that is on or off;
socket_fd => Contains server socket fd;
clients_socket_fd[] => Contains all clients sockets_fd;

send_to_all_clients(buffer){
    This function reads all values of clients_socket_fd[];
    Sends buffer at clients_socket_fd[i] if isn't _EMPTY;
}

recver(index){ // Thread
    This function receives all message from clients_socket_fd[index];
    Adopts a defensize behaviour in case of connection problems;
}

accepter(){ // Thread
    At first and once, this function sets all values of clients_socket_fd[] to _EMPTY;
    Next, it accepts all new clients if there are still free places in clients_socket_fd[].
    This new client is inited with recver();
}

finish_main(){
    Prints end message at the end of the process;
}

main(){
    At first, makes all server configurations and sets the targeted address;
    Secondly, starts accepter();
    Endly, starts the admin console of the server. In case of _EXIT_COMMAND it tells all clients
    about server shutdwon and after shutdowns the server;
}

#1		CLIENT SIDE

working => Flag to tell the system that is on or off;
socket_fd => Contains socket fd;

sender(socket_fd){ // Thread
    This function is a small terminal that permits at the user to write and send message to the server;
    Adopts a defensize behaviour in case of connection problems;
    If the _EXIT_COMMAND is entered, it tells the serveur about the exiting and shutdowns this client;
}

recver(socket_fd){
    This function receives all message from the server;
    Adopts a defensize behaviour in case of connection problems;
}

finish_main(){ 
    Prints end message at the end of the process;
}

main(){
    At first, makes connection configurations and sets the targeted address;
    Next, starts sender() and recver();
    While is working doing nothing else shutdowns this client;
}
