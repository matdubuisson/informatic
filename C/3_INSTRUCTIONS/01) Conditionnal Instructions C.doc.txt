#1		CONDITIONNAL INSTRUCTIONS

#5	if else

#2	Description
3# if(boolean) instruction   3# => Receives the value of a boolean
and executes its code block if the boolean isn't null;
3# else instruction          3# => Executes its block of code if the
last if of its own block hasn't worked as the boolean has been null;

For example :

ifAndElse.c : 2// 
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){

  printf("What is your favorite character ? \n");
  char c = 4;
  if((c = getchar()) == 48) printf("You have written zero !!\n");
  else if(c == 49) printf("You have written one !!\n");
  else printf("You have written something else...\n");

  if((c = getchar()) == '\n'){
    printf("The second character is the changer of line !!\n");
  }
  else if(1){
    // Never executed. This else depends of the last if()
    // Normally it executes the next if()
  }
  else{
    // Never executed. This else depends on the last if()
    // so the if() from the last else if()
  }

  /* =================================================== */

  printf("What is your favorite number ?\n");
  unsigned int nbr;
  scanf("%d", &nbr);

  if(nbr >= 100){
    printf("Your number has three characters !!\n");
  }
  else if(nbr < 10){
    printf("Your number has only one character !!\n");
  }
  else{
    printf("Your number has two characters !!\n");
  }

  return 0;
}

Into the console : 2# 
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/C/INSTRUCTION/EXAMPLE$ ./prog 
What is your favorite character ?

You have written something else...
The second character is the changer of line !!

#5	switch, case, default, break

#2	Description
3# switch(data){ instructions } 3# => Checks several conditions as if 
and else and executes the appropriate blocks of instructions;
==> 3# case test_data: 3# => Executes the following instructions
if the data equals the test_data. The syntax is similar to python;
==> 3# default: 3# => Same principe but the condition is always 
validated;  
====> 3# break 3# => Stops the execution of the switch;

switch.c : 2// 
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned char main(unsigned char argc, unsigned char **argv){

    unsigned int value;
    printf("Choose your value : ");
    scanf("%d", &value);

    switch(value){
        case 0:
            printf("It is 0 !!\n");
            break;
        case 1:
            printf("It is 1 !! Warning, without break it executes the next case (or default)\n");
        case 2:
            printf("It is 2 !!\n");
            break;
        case -4000:
            printf("Not possible !!\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Either it's 1 or it isn't in [0, 1, 2] !!\n");
            break;

In the console : 2// 
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/C/3_INSTRUCTIONS/EXAMPLE$ gcc switch.c -o prog
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/C/3_INSTRUCTIONS/EXAMPLE$ ./prog 
Choose your value : 0
It is 0 !!
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/C/3_INSTRUCTIONS/EXAMPLE$ ./prog 
Choose your value : 1
It is 1 !! Warning, without break it executes the next case (or default)
It is 2 !!
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/C/3_INSTRUCTIONS/EXAMPLE$ ./prog 
Choose your value : 2
It is 2 !!
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/C/3_INSTRUCTIONS/EXAMPLE$ ./prog 
Choose your value : 4
Either it's 1 or it isn't in [0, 1, 2] !!
