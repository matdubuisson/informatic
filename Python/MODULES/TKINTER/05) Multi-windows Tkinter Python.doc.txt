				MULTI-WINDOWS

#4	Toplevel()
This function with a thread permits to create a seconde window so a child-window.
This function plays the same job than Tk() but for a child. This child-window
doesn't need of mainloop() and quit(). When the main-window is closed, it
automatically closes all child-windows.
