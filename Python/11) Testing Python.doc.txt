#1		RAISING OF ERRORS

#3	assert
This key word permits to write some test.
Syntax : 5# 
assert waited_boolean, "Raised error !!"
 5#
In fact, we can write a condition that we think to get
if the test is success else the program'll be interupted
by a raised error of this assert. So assert raises an error
when the result is False else it hasn't effects.

#3	raise
This keyword of Python permits to raise a personalised error.
There is one function for each types of error as NameError(),
ZeroDivisionError(), IndexError()... And these function take
a parameter that is a text message to print on the screen when
the error occurs. By example : 2# 
raise ZeroDivisionZero("!! Tu peux pas diviser par zero !!")
 2#

#1		TESTING

#3	try
This prefix permits to try a bit of code. If an error occurs
during the process, the program'll stop only the block of
the [ try ].

#3	except , except errorName
This prefix permits to execute a block of code only if the
previous [ try ] has had an occured error.
An [ except ] needs to have a [ try ] but a
[ try ] cans have several [ except ].

#3	finally
This prefix permits to execute a code after [ try ] and
[ except ] no matter what if the [ try ] had an occured error
or not.

For example : 2# 
fileName = input("What is the file to read ? ")
try:
  if fileName == "testing.py":
    raise NameError("This name is reserved to the program !!")
  with open(fileName, "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
  print("The file doesn't exist or it is in an other directory !!")
except:
  print("This except is activated because you have input testing.py !!")
finally:
  print("Finally I'm always executed !!")
 2#

Into the console : 2// 
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/Python/EXAMPLE/testing$ py testing.py 
What is the file to read ? errors.py
raise ZeroDivisionError("Test !!")

Finally I'm always executed !!
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/Python/EXAMPLE/testing$ py testing.py 
What is the file to read ? zat'g
The file doesn't exist or it is in an other directory !!
Finally I'm always executed !!
racteur@racteurleader:~/Documents/informatic/Python/EXAMPLE/testing$ py testing.py 
What is the file to read ? testing.py
This except is activated because you have input testing.py !!
Finally I'm always executed !!
