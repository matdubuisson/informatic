				MODULAR PROGRAMATION

#3	import
This syntax permits to include the coding of an other [ file.py ].
The prefix asks only the name of the file without the extension.
For using a function of an external file the function needs to
reference to its file as [ importedFile.fct() ]
Ex : 2# 
import tool # from tool.py
import tkinter # from tkinter.py
tool.yolo()
tkinter.tkinter_function()
 2#

#3	from , as
These two words permits to change the work of [ import ].
as => Permits to change the reference;
from => Permits to import one or several functions of a
file so there isn't need of the reference after it;
Ex : 2# 
form tool import yolo
import tkinter as tk
from tatayoyo import *
yolo() # from tool.py
tk.tkinter_function() # from tkinter.py
powa(); Ibisibou(); gg() # from tatayoyo.py
 2#
