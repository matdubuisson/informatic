				ATTRIBUTS AND METHODS

In the class, the attributs are as the variables of a scope.
In the class, the methods are as the functions of a scope.

#1		BASIC CLASS

#5	class
This key word permits to define a class with a name.
Syntax : 2# 
class Name:
  pass
# Or :
class Name(mother_class): # It is explained in an other script
  pass
 2#
Later it permits to create an instance of this class with
the syntax of : 2# 
instance = Name()
 2#

#5	self
In the previous example above, instance is a pointer that permits
to act with the object. When it works inside the object the key
word that permits to an object tap into its own contain is #5 self.
This key word permits to define attributs and to provide methods
with attibuts or other methods.

#0	__init__(self)
This method permits to do a workload when the instance of the class
is created. This is a method of a class.

#1	Attributs
This is quite simple. In fact, it consists to define kinds of variables
in the class with this manner : self.name_of_variable
The key word (self) means that this variable is declared only inside
the class and is available for an instance of this class.
For calling an attribut : 2// 
class Name:
  def __init__(self):
    self.id = 14
instance = Name()
id = instance.id
 2//
#1	Methods
A method is a function inside a class definition that has the key
word 5# self 5# as first parameter. For calling a method, it's : 2// 
class Name:
  def method(self):
    pass
  def method(self, args):
    pass
instance = Name()
instance.method()
instance.method(args)
=> Instance is the first parameter (self)
=> The method could have no parameters else args is the other
parameters after the first (self)
 2//

By example : 2# 
>>> class Name:
...   def __init__(self, id, NAME):
...     self.id = id
...     self.name = NAME
...   def prt0(self):
...     print(self.id, self.name)
...   def prt1(self, thing):
...     print(self.name, thing)
... 
>>> instance = Name(14, "Joe")
>>> instance.prt0()
14 Joe
>>> instance.id = 16
>>> instance.prt0()
16 Joe
>>> instance.prt1("Yolo !!")
Joe Yolo !!
