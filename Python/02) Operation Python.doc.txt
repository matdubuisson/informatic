				OPERATION

#1		ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
#3	[ a + b ]
It is used for calculs and addition of string.
This is an additon of a with b : 2# 
>>> 4 + 6
10
>>> "Salut" + " comment Ã§a va ?"
'Salut comment Ã§a va ?'
 2#

#3	[ a - b ]
This is a substraction of b in a : 2# 
>>> 4 - 6
-2
 2#

#3      [ a * b ]
It is used for calculus and replication of strings.
This is a multiplication of a with b : 2# 
>>> 4 * 6
24
>>> 4 * "a"
'aaaa'
>>> "fun " * 4
'fun fun fun fun '
 2#

#3      [ a / b ]
This is a division of a on b : 2# 
>>> 4 / 6
0.6666666666666666
>>> 7/9
0.7777777777777778
>>> 9/9
1.0
 2#

#3      [ a ** b ]
This is a exponent b : 2# 

 2#

#3      [ a // b ]
This is a division of a by b and returns the smaller integer
of the response : 2# 
>>> 4 // 6
0
>>> 25 // 6
4
>>> 99 // 10
9
 2#

#3      [ a % b ]
This is a modulo so the rest of the division of a by b : 2# 
>>> 4 % 5
4
>>> 24 % 7
3
 2#

#1		CONDITIONNAL OPERATORS

#3      [ a == b ]
If a equals b

#3      [ a != b ]
If a is different than b

#3      [ a > b ]
If a is grander than b

#3      [ a < b ]
If a is smaller than b

#3      [ a =< b ]
If a is smaller than b of equals b

#3      [ a => b ]
If a is grander than b or equals b

#1		LOGICAL OPERATORS

#3      [ not ]
True => False
False => True

#3      [ and ]
False + False => False
False + True => False
True + False => False
True + True => True

#3      [ or ]
False + False => False
False + True => True
True + False => True
True + True => True

#1		SEQUENTIAL OPERATORS

#3	[ , ]
This permits to chain some same instructions or exange some values
between variables : 2# 
>>> a = 4
>>> b = 6
#0 >>> a,b = b,a
>>> print(a)
6
>>> print(b)
4
>>> c = 1
>>> d = 2
>>> e = 3
>>> c,d,e = e,c,d
>>> print(c, d, e)
3 1 2
 2#

#3	[ ; ]
