#1		BASICS

The html language is shaped with tags. A tag has two parts :
=> The first with all the parameters :
<head>
<p style="">
=> The second that closes :
</head>
</p>

#1              PRINCIPAL TAGS

These are html, head and body with <!DOCTYPE html> at the begin of the page.
Syntax : 5# 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head> <!-- Takes the links of the other files and define the references (title) for the wed  -->
  </head>
  <body> <!-- Contains the web with the compenents -->
  </body>
</html>
 5#

For example : 2# 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> A single title !! Yolo !! </title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p> A sentence !! </p>
  </body>
</html>
 2#
