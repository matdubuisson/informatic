				BASIC FUNCTIONS

#1 Program's body :

#4		setup()
This function is executed just once in the program
at the begin before let execute the function loop().

#4		loop()
This function waites that setup() is finished.

#1 Running the digitals :

#4		pinMode()
This function gives to a pin a job who is either OUTPUT
or INPUT.
Parameters :
Par0 = Position's number of the digital;
Par1 = OUTPUT or INPUT;

#4		digitalRead()
This function reads if a digital is connected or not
(or if it's HIGH or LOW). The function returns an
integer response who is 0 or 1.
Parameters :
Par0 = Position's number of the digital;
Par1 = HIGH (=1) or LOW (=0);

#4		digitalWrite()
This function defines the value of a digital. It gives
to a digital the value HIGH or LOW.
Parameters :
Par0 = Position's number of the digital;
Par1 = HIGH (=1) or LOW (=0);

#1 Data's exchange between computer and Arduino :

#4		analogRead()
This function returns in integer the value of a pin sensor.
Parameters :
Par0 = The integer variable who contains the number of the
tip sensor;

#4		analogWrite()
This function permits to define the intensity of the current
at a pin. The intensity is noticed by an interval of integers
who is between 0 and 255.
Parameters :
Par0 = The integer variable who contains the number of the
tip sensor;
Par1 = The intensity (0-255);

#1 Serial :

#5		Serial
This is the struct who contains the running of the Serial
console.

#4		Serial.print()
This function exactly workes the function print in python.

#1 Timing :

#4		delay()
This functions permits to wait a precised time before
executing the rest of the program. The time is noticed
in millisecondes.
Parameters :
Par0 = Number of millisecondes;

#4		millis()
This function returns a integer number who is the passed
time since program's early.
There is not parameters.

#1 Piezo :

#4		tone()
This function permits to produce a sound with a piezo.
The value of the sounds is in Hertz [Hz].
Parameters :
par0 ==> The pin who aliments the piezo.
par1 ==> The frequency of the sound.
par3 ==> This parameters isn't obligatory but it's the
delay of the sound.

#4		noTone()
This function permits to stop a tone of a piezo (baffle).
Parameter :
par0 ==> The pin who aliments the piezo.

#1 Other :

#4		map()
This function permits to change the convention of interval
of a data. It reput the data from an interval into a new
interval. By example : [ DATA = 2 ] between [ MI0 = 0 ] 
and [ MA0 = 4 ], if the new interval
is between [ MI1 = 0 ] and [ MA1 = 8 ] DATA = 4.
Parameters :
Par0 ==> DATA;
Par1 ==> MI0;
Par2 ==> MI1;
Par3 ==> MA0;
Par4 ==> MA1;
